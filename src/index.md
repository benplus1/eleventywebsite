# Hi, I'm Ben!

I am currently a MS student in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. I am super fortunate to be working under Professor [Steven Feiner](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/) and Professor [Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/). My research interests are in augmented reality and virtual reality. More specifically, Iâ€™m interested in multimodal perception and biometrics in VR/AR, and how ML/AI supports these intersections.

Before Columbia, I received a B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Cognitive Science from Rutgers University.

I'm also interested in skiing, climbing, volleyball, and fantasy literature!
