# Hi, I'm Ben.

My name is Ben Yang and Iâ€™m an MS student at Columbia University, researching VR/AR, Computer Graphics, AI, and any interdisciplinary interactions with these fields. I graduated from Rutgers with a B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Cognitive Science. I'm also interested in skiing, climbing, and fantasy literature!

I live for ski mountaineering. I also live for music - I'm a guitarist and singer. I keep monthly
playlists on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/e8yylicycxba6487r7jbyotbo?si=wEo1wvS1SsaObFezR8DwJA), if you
want to check out what I'm listening to.

You can find my open-source work and personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/benplus1).
