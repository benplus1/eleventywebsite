# Hi, I'm Ben!

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, working at the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab. I am super fortunate to be working under Professor [Steven Feiner](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/). As an M.S. student, I also worked under Professor [Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/). 

My primary research interests are in augmented reality, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction. Specific topics include multimodal perception, biometrics in VR/AR, pose estimation, human-data interaction / visualization, and how ML/AI supports these interactions.

Before Columbia, I received a B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Cognitive Science from Rutgers University.

I'm also interested in skiing, climbing, volleyball, and fantasy literature!

You can find my open-source work and personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/benplus1). My LinkedIn can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentyang/).

If you'd like to chat, I'm reachable via email at `by2297@columbia.edu`!
