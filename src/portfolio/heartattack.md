Heart Attack is a horror video game built in Unity for the HTC VIVE Pro. The game takes eye tracking and heart rate data to spawn monsters, control creature movement, and flicker the lights on and off. The Tobii XR SDK is used to support these interactions. Several puzzles are also included to open doors and advance in the game. A minimap is also included in the game as well.
